 - How is a block defined with fenced divs?

## Formatting

Fenced divs in [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) have simpler and [more flexible
syntax](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) than HTML div tags. 
They consist of a series of *at least* 3 colons (`:::`) (followed by a class for
opening tags) for delimiting blocks.Note that vertical space is not as important
for these tags as HTML tags are.

### Defining blocks

Blocks are defined by placing a series of *at least* 3 colons (`:::`) on a blank
line followed by the name of the class. Blocks are closed with *at least* 3 
colons on a new line. For example:

```markdown
::: challenge

This is a *challenge*

:::

:::::: callout

This is a *callout*

::::::::::::::
```

:::::::::::::::::::::: callout

## Tip

The number of colons in the opening tag does not need to match the number of
colons in the closing tag, but it's a good idea to include enough for visual
clarity.

::::::::::::::::::::::


### Nesting blocks

Blocks are nested similar to div tags in that you can open a new tag in an 
already open block to nest. For example:

```markdown
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

This is a *challenge*

:::::::::::::::::::::: callout

This is a *callout* inside a *challenge*

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This is a *challenge* again

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
```

### What to watch out for 

Make sure your colons always start at the beginning of the line. 

```markdown

::: callout

Good

::::::::::::

 ::: callout
 
 Bad (space before opening tag)
 
 :::::::::::
 
:::: callout
Good (but not preferred)

::::::::::::

:::: callout
Bad (closing tag is not processed)
::::::::::::
```

# Example

This example shows a nested solution inside of a challenge block

![Example of markdown with fenced div blocks from pandoc specifying a challenge and solution block](fig/fenced-div-simple.png)

```{r fenced-div, child = "files/fenced-div-challenge.Rmd", echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
```
