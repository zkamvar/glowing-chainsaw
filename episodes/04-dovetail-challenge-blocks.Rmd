 - How is a block defined with {dovetail}?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

# Challenge block {dovetail}

## Formatting

The [{dovetail}](https://github.com/carpentries/dovetail#readme) syntax provides
a way to write div tags inside of code blocks prefixed by a special comment
character (`#' `). 

### Defining blocks

Blocks are defined like RMarkdown code chunks, starting with three backtics
followed by the type of block in curly braces (```` ```{type} ````). Blocks are
closed with three backtics on a new line: ```` ``` ````. For example

`````{r catchal1, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cat("````markdown\n```{challenge}
#' This is a *challenge*\n```\n\n```{callout}
#' This is a *callout*\n```\n````")
`````

 Code is treated as a special entity in the blocks and does not
necessarily need to be preceded by `#' ` to allow for syntax highlighting in 
most editors.

#### Nesting blocks

To nest a block, you should include it in the block as `#' @type Title` where
`@type` is the type of block and `Title` is a header associated with that block.
For example, `#' @solution Precipitate` will start a new solution block inside of
the current block with the title "Precipitate". 

If there is no more content after the nested block, it will be closed
automatically at the end of the chunk and nothing more is required on your part.
If you need to include more prose in the outer block, then you can close a 
nested block with `#' @end`


`````{r catchal, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
cat("````markdown\n```{challenge}
#' This is a *challenge*
#'
#' @callout
#'
#' This is a *callout* inside a *challenge*
#'
#' @end
#'
#' This is a *challenge* again
```\n````")
`````
