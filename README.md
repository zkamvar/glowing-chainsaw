This lesson is inteneded for you to provide feedback to the Lesson Infrastructure
Technology Developer about what method you prefer to constructing the [special
blockquotes](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/04-formatting/index.html#special-blockquotes)
featured in Carpentries lessons.

:::::::::: prereq

## Instructions

We have devised three potential candidates for replacing the blockquote syntax 
and would like ranked feedback on the syntax you prefer after completing three
tasks with all three of the candidate syntaxes:
 
 1. re-generate a simple example challenge/solution block
 2. re-generate a complex example challenge/solution block
 3. convert a code block from an established lesson to your preferred syntax

## Note

We do not expect you to render these on your own. Please edit these on your own
computer with the editor you feel most comfortable with and then submit them
in the google form. 

::::::::::::::::::::::

In the first lesson, you will be provided with images of code blocks generated 
via <https://carbon.now.sh/> and the corresponding output generated from that
syntax. The second, third, and fourth lessons will present the challenges with
a link to a google form to enter your responses.

Good luck!
